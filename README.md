Coreutils implemented in Rust, with a focus on usability, speed and security. 


## Goals

-   Do one thing and do it well.
-   One program gets one repository.
-   Shared functionality between programs can be split between multiple file.
-   Shared functionality between programs should be outsourced into crates.
-   DRY â€” don't repeat yourself.
-   Keep everything well-documented.
-   If you can, keep the number of syscalls low.
-   Try to be as compatible as possible with existing implementations.
-   Have sane defaults, avoid over-customisability. 
-   Ease of use is most important.

## Security

-   Use all available security features on each platform (eg. `pledge` on BSD,
    `libseccomp` on Linux).
-   Small codebase, easy to audit.
